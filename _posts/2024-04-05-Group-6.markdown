## Introduction

This project focuses on deep learning methods and provides scripts and notebooks that help build, train, and analyze models efficiently. The structure includes various components such as configuration settings, model creation tools, and utilities for model training and visualization.

## Dataset
ISPRS Postdam Dataset

this dataset include 37 pictures per type(IRRG, Digital surface model, label).
each image 6000*6000*3

## Model(s)
we used unet transunet, umamba and ukan as the figure showing.

## Results
Regarding the effects of the sources of data
No improvement for adding DSM for training Unet
Noticeable improvement for large network, e.g. UKan, TransUnet

Regarding loss functions
The experiments in UKan showed that there is no significant difference between HybridLoss, CrossEntropy, FocalLoss
The failure in MultiClassDiceLoss might be due to the class imbalance in the dataset

Regarding the effects of learning rate
For UKan & Unet, there is a significant improvement in training miou but not in validation miou
A sign for overfitting, 1e-3 should be a better learning rate
