## Semantic segmentation in ISPRS-Potsdam dataset

## Authors

- Maritza Corona Hernandez
- Pankaj Rajoria

## Dataset

The dataset used in our experiments is the [2D Semantic Labeling Contest - Potsdam](https://www.isprs.org/education/benchmarks/UrbanSemLab/2d-sem-label-potsdam.aspx)

The data set contains 38 patches (all images have a dimension of 6000 x 6000 pixels), each consisting of a true orthophoto (TOP) extracted from a larger TOP mosaic. The ground sampling distance of both, the TOP and the DSM, is 5 cm. The DSM was generated via dense image matching with Trimble INPHO 5.6 software and Trimble INPHO OrthoVista was used to generate the TOP mosaic.

## Model
The model employed is UNetformer.

## Results

We obtained the following results:

| Model    |              Description             |
|:--------:|:--------------------------------------:|
| ResNet18 | We trained with same backbone on GitHub |
| Baseline | Same as GeoSeg GitHub                   |
| ResNet50 | Using ResNet50 as backbone              |
