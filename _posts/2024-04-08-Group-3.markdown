## Dataset
<body>
    <p>This very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing image dataset was constructed by Dr. Gong Cheng et al. from Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU). It includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>715 color images acquired from Google Earth with spatial resolution ranging from 0.5 to 2 meters.</li>
        <li>85 pansharpened color infrared images acquired from Vaihingen data with a spatial resolution of 0.08 meters.</li>
        <li>In total, 800 VHR remote sensing images.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each line of the corresponding text files defines a ground truth bounding box with the following coordinates:</p>
    <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>(x1, y1)</strong> â€“ [top-left coordinate]</p>
        <p><strong>(x2, y2)</strong> â€“ [bottom-right coordinate]</p>
    </div>
    <p>The object classes are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1</strong> â€“ Airplane</li>
        <li><strong>2</strong> â€“ Ship</li>
        <li><strong>3</strong> â€“ Storage Tank</li>
        <li><strong>4</strong> â€“ Baseball Diamond</li>
        <li><strong>5</strong> â€“ Tennis Court</li>
        <li><strong>6</strong> â€“ Basketball Court</li>
        <li><strong>7</strong> â€“ Ground Track Field</li>
        <li><strong>8</strong> â€“ Harbor</li>
        <li><strong>9</strong> â€“ Bridge</li>
        <li><strong>10</strong> â€“ Vehicle</li>
    </ul>
